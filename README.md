# Air-Pollution-Disease-Analysis
A data-driven analysis of U.S. air pollution (2000-2006) using a dataset of over 1.4 million daily observations.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between air pollution levels and disease outcomes across U.S. states using R. The goal is to explore patterns, trends, and potential associations between environmental factors and public health indicators through data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and exploratory statistical analysis.

This repository is structured to follow good data science and reproducible research practices, with clear separation between raw/processed data, scripts, notebooks, and visual outputs.
